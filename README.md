Egg Timer is a fork off of a old Egg Timer utility (whose website has since been taken off line) which hasn't been updated in a very long time.

I wanted a simple timer utility and had some free time so I decided to start hacking at the Egg Timer source in attempt to make it usable again. It took a lot of reorganization and code cleanup but something fairly nice is starting to take shape. There is still a bit to be done before a actual release ('Add Reminder' panel code is a mess), but the application is usable if you wish to download the source code and compile the program for yourself.

Below are some screenshots to give you a little preview of what is to come.

*This application is very old, releasing the code in case it's useful to anyone*
